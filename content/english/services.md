    title: "Import - Export &#128062;"
    description: "Moving overseas is no reason to give up your loyal companion, your pet is more than happy to live anywhere as long as you are there. Whether you’re relocating or on vacation, when traveling with your pet to another country, you must fulfill specific requirements determined by each country which can change frequently. Pets to home will take care of the whole process: import documents, export documents, flight booking, air crate preparation, pick up and delivery, customs clearance, and more."

    title: "Sale of crates and accessories &#128062;"
    description: "We provide airline-approved crates of all sizes. Consider that your pet's size dictates the crate size: in general, no part of your pet should be taller or longer than his crate when standing outside of it, and it should have enough space for him to stand up, turn around and stretch comfortably. Proper crate size is crucial as the airline charges according to the volume of the travel crate. In addition, we offer travel accessories such as food plates and water bottles."
