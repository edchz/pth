    title: "Sale of crates and accessories &#128062;"
    description: "We offer airline-approved crates in various sizes for your beloved pet. It's important to choose a crate based on your pet's size - their crate should be big enough for them to stand up, turn around and stretch comfortably. Additionally, no part of your pet should be taller or longer than the crate when they're standing outside of it. Remember that the airline charges based on the crate's volume, hence choosing the right size is crucial. We also provide travel accessories such as food plates and water bottles."
